# ASSIGNMENT 2 â€“ EXPLORING NEW RESEARCH IN TEXT MINING

## Objectives

* [cite_start]To grasp and understand modern research directions in the field of Text Mining and NLP[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]To become familiar with the empirical research process in artificial intelligence (AI): from reading and understanding scientific papers, setting up, and reproducing results to extending or improving models[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]To practice teamwork skills, research thinking, and working with open-source code[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]To help students keep up with the global development of AI science, especially methods published from 2019 onwards[cite: 7].

## Execution Format

* [cite_start]Work in groups, with a maximum of 4 students per group[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]Each group must submit a technical report and runnable source code (with execution instructions)[cite: 10].

## Main Tasks

* [cite_start]**Choose a project (repo) on GitHub** related to Text Mining or Natural Language Processing (NLP)[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]Priority should be given to repos with a high number of stars, which indicates credibility, a wide user community, and complete documentation[cite: 14].
    * [cite_start]The project should be accompanied by or related to a scientific paper so the group can read, analyze, and compare[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Read and understand the accompanying academic document**[cite: 16].
    * [cite_start]Summarize the main idea of the paper/method[cite: 17].
    * [cite_start]Explain the main concepts or models used[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Install, run, and reproduce** the repo's experiments[cite: 19].
    * [cite_start]Prepare the input data[cite: 19].
    * [cite_start]Run the experiments according to the instructions[cite: 20].
    * [cite_start]Evaluate the results and compare them with the results in the original paper or documentation[cite: 21].

## Extension or Further Development (Optional)

* [cite_start]Implement a project on a larger scale than Assignment 1[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]Apply modern methods (from 2019 onwards)[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]Train or fine-tune the model on real-world data[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]Propose improvements or further experiments with different models, different data, or different languages[cite: 26].

## Some Suggested Topic Directions

* [cite_start]Sentiment Analysis [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]Fake News or Spam Detection [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]Automatic Text Summarization [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]Text Clustering or Topic Modeling [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]Semantic Search [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]Chatbot / Question Answering [cite: 33]
* [cite_start]Keyword / Information Extraction [cite: 34]
* [cite_start]Other research directions related to Text Mining and NLP [cite: 35]

## Required Submission Products

* [cite_start]**Slides + demo source code:** [cite: 37]
    * [cite_start]Introduction of the topic and group objectives [cite: 38]
    * [cite_start]Introduction of the model, paper, and GitHub repo [cite: 39]
    * [cite_start]The process of installation, execution, and experimentation [cite: 40]
    * [cite_start]Results and evaluation [cite: 41]
    * [cite_start]Comments, analysis, and proposed improvements (if any) [cite: 42]
* [cite_start]**Source code and experimental data** [cite: 43]
    * [cite_start]GitHub repo or Google Drive link (if the code file is too large) [cite: 44]
    * [cite_start]Instructions on how to install, run the code, and check the results[cite: 45].
